        <h1>The Chase Calculator</h1>
        <p>Amount to Call : (Current Pot + Opponent bet)</p>
        <p>$15 to win (15 + 15) = $30</p>
        <p>15:30 = 1:2 = 33 percent pot odds needed.</p>
        <p>But our draw only has 16 percent chance to hit on next card.</p>
        <p>We are being asked to pay 33 percent equity for a 16 percent chance.</p>
