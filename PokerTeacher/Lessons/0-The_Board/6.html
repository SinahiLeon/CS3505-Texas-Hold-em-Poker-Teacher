        <h1>The Board</h1>
        <p>The player to their left has to make a larger bet, known
            as the ‘big blind’</p>
        <p>Again, this is determined before the game starts, and the
            size of these blinds is often used to describe the size of the stakes.</p>
        <p>In the example of a ‘$1/$2 game’, the blinds are $1 and $2.</p>

        <p>Once the blinds are in the pot, the first betting round then takes
            place, with every player required to either call (bet up to) the bet
            of $2, raise it, or fold</p>
