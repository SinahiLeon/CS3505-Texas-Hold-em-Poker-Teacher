        <h1>The Board</h1>
        <p>These are the community cards. They get dealt out in phases.</p>
        <p>Any card here can be used by anybody simultaneously to create hands.</p>
        <p>Note: we can sometimes use other players’ reactions to these community
        cards to guess what hole cards they have.</p>
