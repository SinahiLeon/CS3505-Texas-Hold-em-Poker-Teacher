        <p>Good raise! 98s is a great hand ON THE BUTTON because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It plays well post-flop (can make straights/flushes)</li>
            <li>Position lets us see what opponents do first</li>
            <li>We can steal blinds when they have weak hands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In early position, we might fold this hand.</p>
