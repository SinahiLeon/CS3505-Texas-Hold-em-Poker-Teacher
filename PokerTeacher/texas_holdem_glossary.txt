-------------------------------
  BASIC GAME TERMS
-------------------------------

Blinds: Forced bets that start each hand.
  • Small Blind: Half the minimum bet.
  • Big Blind: Minimum bet.
These rotate around the table each hand.

Button: The dealer position marker that rotates clockwise after each hand.
The player on the button acts last post-flop.

Hole Cards: The two private cards dealt face-down to each player.

Community Cards: The five cards dealt face-up in the middle of the table that all
players can use:
    • Flop – First three community cards
    • Turn – Fourth community card
    • River – Fifth and final community card

Pot: The total amount of chips in the middle that players are competing to win.

Showdown: When remaining players reveal their hole cards after the final betting
round to determine the winner.


-------------------------------
HAND STRENGTH & BOARD TYPES
-------------------------------

Wet Board: A flop with many draws and connections (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♥). Dangerous
because many hands can improve.

Dry Board: A flop with few draws (e.g., K♣ 2♦ 4♥). Safe for strong made hands.

Connected Board: Cards are close in rank, creating straight possibilities.

Suited Board: Multiple cards of the same suit, creating flush possibilities.

Paired Board: Two cards of the same rank on the board.

Made Hand: A hand that does not need to improve to win (top pair, set, straight).

Drawing Hand: A hand that needs specific cards to become strong (e.g., flush
draw, straight draw).


-------------------------------
STACK SIZES
-------------------------------

Stack: The total number of chips a player has.

Deep Stack: Having many chiips (usually 100+ big blinds).

Short Stack: Having few chips (usually 20 big blinds or less).

Effective Stack: The smaller stack size between you and an opponent, determining the
maxiumum you can win from each other.

All-In: Betting all your remaining chips.


-------------------------------
BETTING & STRATEGY TERMS
-------------------------------

Bluff: Betting or raising with a weak hand to make opponents fold better hands.

Semi-Bluff: Betting with a drawing hand that could improve to the best hand.

Value Bet: Betting with a strong hand to get called by worse hands.

Continuation Bet (C-Bet): Betting on the flop after raising pre-flop.

Check-Raise: Checking when it's your turn, then raising after an opponent bets.

Pot Odds: The ratio between the current pot size and the cost of a call.

Implied Odds: Potential future chips you expect to win if your hand improves.

Fold Equity: Chance that your bet will make an opponent fold.

Position: Where you sit relative to the button. Early position acts first,
late position acts last.


-------------------------------
RULE OF 2 & RULE OF 4
-------------------------------

Rule of 2:
  • Use when you'll see only 1 more card (turn OR river)
  • Multiply your outs by 2 to get approximate percentage.
  • Example: Flush draw (9 outs) = 9 * 2 → 18% chance.

Rule of 4:
  • Use when you'll see 2 more cards (turn AND river)
  • Multiply your outs by 4 to get approximate percentage.
  • Example: Flush draw (9 outs) = 9 * 4 → 36% chance.

Note: These are approximations but accurate enough for quick decisions at the table.


-------------------------------
BETTING ACTIONS
-------------------------------

Check: Passing the action to the next player without betting (only possible if
no one has bet yet).

Call: Matching the current bet amount.

Raise: Increasing the current bet amount.

Re-raise: Raising after someone has already raised.

Fold: Discarding your hand and sitting out the rest of the hand.
