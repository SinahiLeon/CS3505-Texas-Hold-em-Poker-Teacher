Hole Cards:
The two private cards dealt face-down to each player.

Community Cards:
The five shared cards dealt face-up in the middle of the table.

Flop:
The first three community cards.

Turn:
The fourth community card.

River:
The fifth and final community card.

Pot:
The total amount of chips in the middle that players are competing to win.

Showdown:
When remaining players reveal their hole cards after the final betting round to determine the winner.

Hand Strength & Board Types
-------------------------------

Wet Board:
A flop with many possible draws and connections (e.g., 9♠ 8♠ 7♥). Many hands can improve.

Dry Board:
A flop with few possible draws (e.g., K♣ 2♦ 4♥). Safer for made hands.

Connected Board:
Cards close in rank, creating straight possibilities.

Suited Board:
Two or more cards of the same suit, enabling flush possibilities.

Paired Board:
Two cards of the same rank appear on the board.

Made Hand:
A hand that is already strong and doesn’t need to improve to win (e.g., top pair, straight, set).

Drawing Hand:
A hand that needs specific cards to improve to a strong hand (e.g., flush draw, straight draw).
